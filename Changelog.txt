24.1.
- swapped nframes and rframes in force vector generation => relax time now independent of creep/ramp order
- default BA parameters (Win/Dist -> 40/40) for Tweezers (40x) => bead detection in subframe now more reliable

25.1.
- introduced criterion max(f1,f2)>2.0 to move needle from the beginning
- late writes are now (partially) compensated by shift +1 in force vector

30.1.
- added total_mass < 30 as criterion to stop measurement (SaveThread.cpp)
- fixed bug in calculation of first tinfo->dist value (SaveThread.cpp)
- catch infinite current values (tweezers.cpp)
- changed initial value of residual to that of ANTI_VOLTAGE (tweezers.cpp)
- only closest bead written to eval.txt (SaveThread.cpp)

3.2.
- additional offset to current due to hysteresis (tweezers.cpp)

8.2.
- added SaveToDiskThread - removed again...
- added wait Samples (TriggerThread.cpp)

9.2.
- changed wait Samples to Tweezers.cpp (was wrong)
- changed residual current calib + method

15.3.
- changed calibration to offset(AV)-relative coefficients
- changed remanence to offset(AV)-relative values
- fixed bug in needle-distance update if needle is moved
- fixed bug in tweezers object reinitialization (-0.09 => AV)

18.5.
- changed needle movement, now moving whenever tinfo.dist is < 20 µm
- removed some bugs in force calculation, should finally work now
- needleframe deleted in CycleThread
- bc deleted after SaveThread
- removed some compiler warnings

7.6.
- changed bc and needleframe changes back from last version

20.6.
- changed cam handling, now only inited once

22.6.
- added array_size and anti_voltage to tinfo/config file
- activated optimizations
- removed bc init bug

27.6.
- removed typecast bug in needle movement

29.6.
- changed buffer flush in mikroepp.h, reducing hangs
- removed some debug messages
- changed compiler flags (optimization)

3.7.
- added calib-rem protocol
- cleaned up thread structure
